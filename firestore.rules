/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Ephemeral Notes application.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only
 *  access their own profile data and the notes they have created.
 *
 * @dataStructure The data is structured under /users/{userId}, with each user document
 *  containing profile information. Notes are stored in a subcollection
 *  /users/{userId}/notes/{noteId}.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Users can only access their own data; listing all users is disallowed.
 *   - Notes inherit ownership from their parent user document, simplifying rules.
 *   - Data schema is not strictly enforced to allow for prototyping, but ownership
 *     relationships are strictly validated.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization No denormalization is needed. The path-based structure inherently
 *  ties ownership to the user's UID. Access is controlled by comparing request.auth.uid
 *  to the userId path parameter.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation User profiles and notes are segregated under the /users/{userId}
 *  path, ensuring clear ownership boundaries.
